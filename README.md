Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview

Overview:
This project builds directly on Research Task 5, where I analyzed the SU Women’s Lacrosse team data and generated insights using a large language model (LLM). For Task 6, I transformed that narrative into a fictional AI-generated interview.

Purpose:
The goal is not just to generate a final media product (audio/video), but to explore and document the process of turning data analysis into synthetic dialogue using AI tools.

Files Included:
script: Interview dialogue derived from Task 5's analysis
process notes: My step-by-step process, tools, and reflections
audio_link.txt: Placeholder to paste audio/video link if generated

Tools Used:
ChatGPT for scriptwriting
ElevenLabs for free AI voice generation
