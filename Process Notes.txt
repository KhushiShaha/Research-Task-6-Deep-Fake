Process Notes – Task 06: Deep Fake Interview

Review of Task 5 Narrative:
I began by revisiting the insights and summary from my SU Women’s Lacrosse data analysis project. These insights were transformed into a conversational script.

Scriptwriting:
I wrote the script in an interview format, simulating a conversation between an interviewer and myself. The script incorporates core ideas from the Task 5 summary: prompt quality, LLM reasoning limits, performance metrics, and reflections.

Tool Exploration:
I explored the following tools for generating AI media:
- **TTS Maker** (free): Used to generate test audio clips from the script.
- **ElevenLabs**: Offers realistic voices, limited credits on free tier.
- **D-ID** and **HeyGen**: Considered for lip-sync video generation, but deferred due to limited access.

Testing + Challenges:
- Script had to be broken into parts due to character limits.
- Adding pauses and tone required experimentation with punctuation.
- Audio quality was impressive, but video export is limited on free tools.

Reflection:
This task helped me connect storytelling, scripting, and AI synthesis workflows. It showed me how narrative data analysis can evolve into digital content creation using only free, accessible tools.
